| Classification                        | The code uses the Breast cancer Dataset from SKlearn for training the model                               |
| Regression                            | We find the curve which fits the Moore's Law                                                              |
| 3-input, 1-output node Neural Network | We will implement a NN which will incorporate 3 inputs and 1 output with tanh as the activation function  |
